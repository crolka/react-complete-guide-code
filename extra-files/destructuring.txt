A method to easily extract array elements or object properties and and stores them in 
variables.

Similar to Spread, however the key difference is that you are allowed to pull out single
elements and store them in variables. Spread acts on the entire array/object. ALL elements/
properties are pulled out of the array/object and distributed into a new variable.
